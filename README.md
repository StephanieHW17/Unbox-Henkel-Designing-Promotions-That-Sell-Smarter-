# Unbox Henkel: Designing Promotions That Sell Smarter  
**Henkel NZ × Woolworths NZ | Graduate Capstone Industry Project**

This project was completed as part of a graduate capstone collaboration between the **University of Auckland** and **Henkel New Zealand**, focusing on evaluating and optimising promotional effectiveness across **Woolworths NZ’s 2024 Spring and Summer Cleaning campaigns**.

The analysis covered three core FMCG categories — **Laundry Detergent, Toilet Care, and Dishwash** — with the objective of identifying which promotional levers drive sales uplift beyond price discounts, and how campaign design can be improved to maximise ROI while protecting long-term brand value.

## 🎯 Project Objective
Retail promotions play a critical role in driving short-term sales, but poorly designed campaigns can lead to stockpiling, post-promotion dips, and brand dilution.

This project aimed to:
- Evaluate the effectiveness of Henkel’s participation in Woolworths’ seasonal campaigns  
- Identify non-price drivers of promotional success (e.g. mailer visibility, pack size, product attributes)  
- Quantify the impact of mailer inclusion and placement on sales performance  
- Translate analytical insights into actionable, business-ready recommendations for future campaign planning

## 📊 Data & Methodology
The analysis was conducted using **weekly SKU-level POS data from Woolworths NZ (Oct 2023 – Oct 2024)**, covering unit sales, pricing, pack formats, product attributes, and promotional participation.

Key analytical approaches included:
- Descriptive analysis to assess baseline vs promotional uplift across categories  
- Fixed-effects panel regression (SKU–week level) to isolate the impact of promotional design choices  
- Manual engineering of mailer position variables to evaluate visibility effects within Woolworths’ digital mailer layout  
- Cross-category comparison to identify scalable promotional patterns  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Mailer inclusion** was the strongest and most consistent driver of sales uplift across all three categories  
- **Mailer position matters**: central and eye-level placements delivered stronger performance, while certain lower-visibility positions significantly underperformed  
- **Pack size effectiveness varies by campaign intent**:  
  - Large packs performed best during *Summer Cleaning* (value-driven stock-up behaviour)  
  - Smaller, fragrance-led SKUs excelled in *Spring Cleaning* (trial and discovery behaviour)  
- **Product attributes influence promotional response**:  
  - Fragrance played a significant role in detergent and toilet care performance  
  - Eco-positioned SKUs performed best when paired with strong visibility and value cues

## 💡 Business Impact & Recommendations
Based on the findings, the project delivered a **data-driven promotional framework** for Henkel NZ:

- Prioritise high-impact mailer positions for new, eco-friendly, or high-margin SKUs  
- Align promo group composition with seasonal shopper missions (trial vs stock-up)  
- Combine mailer exposure with Woolworths *Everyday Rewards Boost* offers to drive repeat engagement  
- Extend the same strategy across adjacent categories (fabric softeners, laundry additives) and other retail partners  

The final recommendations were praised for their **commercial relevance and clarity**, supporting Henkel’s shift toward more structured, insight-led campaign planning.
